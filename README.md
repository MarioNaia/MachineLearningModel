***This repository has the following directories:***

&nbsp;

**Start**
+ Where you analyse in a broader spectrum the input and output you will receive/give.
+ Where you analyse the problem
+ Where you can make some statistics and some graphs in order to understand what's being asked to you

&nbsp;

**Pre-Processing**
+ Where you process the data, deal with outliers and make decisions about your true data
+ Where you clean your data
+ Where you normalize your data

&nbsp;

**Feature Engineering**
+ Where you make features out of the data handled to you
+ You can combine data to make features 
+ You can process some of your data to get some feature

&nbsp;

**1st Level Machine Learning**
+  Where you apply Machine learning algorithms (supervised/unsupervised, classification/regression)
+  You output a meta-feature

**2nd Level Machine Learning (Stacking) **
+  Where you apply Machine learning algorithms (supervised/unsupervised, classification/regression)
+  You can take the features from "Feature Engineering" process and combine them with the meta-features from 1st Level
+  Be aware of the Stacking you are making, some of it might make no sense and makes data worse

**Final**
+ Where you make the weighted average of either or both Geometrical and Arithmetical means of the outputs of 2nd Level
+ Be aware the weights you use and when to use Geometrical and Arithmetical means.
+ Where you make the submission
